    <h2>Emergency first response</h2>
    <p>
      The internet is a place that can be full of inaccurate information about
      first aid treatments, such as putting butter on a burn, or sucking the
      venom from a snake bite. As any first aid instructor will tell you,
      putting butter (or any other food product) on a burn won’t help, and you
      should never attempt to suck the venom out of a snake bite. It’s also a
      bad idea to tip your head back if you have a nosebleed, and not every
      choking victim needs the “Heimlich maneuver” (abdominal thrusts). Relying
      on the internet for first aid advice, instead of taking part in proper
      training, puts you and the casualty at risk, especially in an emergency.
      First aid training gives you the knowledge, confidence and skills to do
      the right thing in situations where every moment matters.
