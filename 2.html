    <h2>Advanced Open Water</h2>
    <p>
      Advanced Open Water Diver (AOWD) is a recreational scuba diving
      certification level provided by several diver training agencies. Agencies
      offering this level of training under this title include Professional
      Association of Diving Instructors (PADI), and Scuba Schools International
      (SSI). Other agencies offer similar training under different titles.
      Advanced Open Water Diver is one step up from entry level certification as
      a beginner autonomous scuba diver to the ISO24901-2 standard. A major
      difference between Autonomous diver equivalent Open Water Diver (OWD)
      certification and AOWD is that the depth limit is increased from 18 to 30
      metres (60 to 100 ft). Prerequisite certification level for AOWD training
      is OWD or a recognized equivalent (ISO 24801-2[1]). Certification
      requirements for AOWD includes theory learning and assessment, practical
      training and assessment, and a minimum requirement for number of logged
      dives, that varies between agencies. SSI requires 24 logged dives.[2] PADI
      requires 5 dives on course, and the prerequisite is OWD which requires 4
      open water dives. No additional logged dives are specified.[3][4]
