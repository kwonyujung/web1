    <h2>Open Water</h2>
    <p>
      n underwater diving, open water is unrestricted water such as a sea, lake
      or flooded quarries. It is the opposite of confined water (diving)
      (usually a swimming pool) where diver training takes place. Open water
      also means the diver has direct vertical access to the surface of the
      water in contact with the Earth's atmosphere.[1] Open water diving implies
      that if a problem arises, the diver can directly ascend vertically to the
      atmosphere to breathe air. Penetration diving—involving entering caves or
      wrecks, or diving under ice—is therefore not "open water diving". In some
      contexts the lack of a decompression obligation is considered a necessary
      condition for classification of a dive as an open water dive, but this
      does not affect the classification of the venue as open water.
      Swim-throughs – the recreational diving term for arches and short, clear,
      tunnels where the light can be seen at the far end, are technically an
      overhead environment, but this is often overlooked by divers as there is
      no risk of getting lost inside, and the risk of entrapment is generally
      low. Divers progress from learning diving skills in "confined water" such
      as a swimming pool to practicing skills in "open water" in which the
      environment is not restricted to a small, controlled locality and depth,
      with conditions typical of a natural body of water which might be used by
      divers.[2] and the range of hazards and associated risk is significantly
      expanded.[3] In this context confined water is a special case of open
      water, as it complies with the more general condition of unobstructed
      access to the surface. Some recreational diver certification agencies use
      a variation on this term in the title of their entry level
      certification.[4][5] Open Water Diver certification implies that the diver
      is competent to dive in unrestricted water, with various constraints
      regarding the conditions, and particularly that their competence is
      limited to diving in open water of with free access to the surface.
